# Basics;
PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres, is an advanced, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, robustness, and performance. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying. PostgreSQL is highly extensible with features such as custom functions and data types, and it supports a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks. Here are some of the basics to get you started with PostgreSQL:

### Key Features

1. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL guarantees atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), ensuring reliable transactions and data integrity.
2. **Rich Data Types**: Supports a wide range of data types including primitive types (integer, numeric, string), structured (date/time, array, range), document (JSON/JSONB, XML, key-value), geometric, and custom types.
3. **Extensibility**: Users can define their own data types, custom functions, and more. It also supports the creation of extensions to add new functionalities.
4. **Concurrency**: Uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle concurrent data access, providing high levels of performance and scalability.
5. **Full-Text Search**: Offers powerful full-text search capabilities that are easy to use.
6. **Security**: Provides strong security features, including robust access control system, column and row-level security, SSL support, and more.

### Basic Operations

#### Installation

PostgreSQL can be installed on various operating systems. On Ubuntu, you can install it using:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

On macOS, using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install postgresql
```

#### Starting and Stopping the Server

On Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo service postgresql start
sudo service postgresql stop
```

On macOS (using Homebrew):

```sh
brew services start postgresql
brew services stop postgresql
```

#### Using the PostgreSQL Command Line Interface

After installation, you can interact with PostgreSQL using the `psql` command-line interface. To start `psql` under the default PostgreSQL user:

```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```

#### Basic SQL Operations

- **Create a Database**:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

- **Switch Connection to a Database**:

```sql
\c mydatabase
```

- **Create a Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

- **Insert Data**:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username) VALUES ('john_doe');
```

- **Query Data**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

- **Update Data**:

```sql
UPDATE users SET username = 'jane_doe' WHERE id = 1;
```

- **Delete Data**:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

#### Connecting to PostgreSQL from an Application

Connecting to PostgreSQL from a programming language or framework typically involves using a database driver or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool specific to your language or framework of choice, such as psycopg2 for Python, pg for Node.js, or ActiveRecord for Ruby on Rails.

### Documentation and Learning

PostgreSQL has comprehensive documentation that covers all aspects of the database, from basic usage to advanced features. The official PostgreSQL documentation is a great place to start learning in depth: [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

As you grow more comfortable with PostgreSQL, you'll discover its powerful features that make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale enterprise systems.





# Using Postgres with a python app;
Using PostgreSQL for a Python app, especially one deployed on Heroku, is a common choice due to PostgreSQL's reliability and robust features. For Python applications, `psycopg2` is a popular PostgreSQL database adapter, enabling you to interact with PostgreSQL databases in an efficient and Pythonic way. Let's go through the basics of setting up and using `psycopg2` in the context of storing configurations for different chats for a Telegram bot written with the Telebot library.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into code examples, ensure you have:

- A PostgreSQL database set up. On Heroku, you can add a Postgres addon to your application from the Heroku dashboard.
- The `psycopg2` package installed in your Python environment. If you're deploying on Heroku, also add it to your `requirements.txt` file.
- Basic knowledge of SQL for creating tables and performing CRUD operations.

### Setting Up `psycopg2`

1. **Install psycopg2**: Install the package using pip. If you're working in a local development environment, run:

   ```sh
   pip install psycopg2-binary
   ```

   For Heroku deployment, add `psycopg2-binary` to your `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Database Connection**: Use the DATABASE_URL from your Heroku Postgres addon to connect to your database. Heroku automatically adds this environment variable when you add a Postgres database.

   ```python
   import psycopg2
   import os

   DATABASE_URL = os.environ['DATABASE_URL']

   conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL, sslmode='require')
   ```

### Basic Operations with `psycopg2`

#### Creating a Table

To store configurations for different chats, you'll need a table. Here's an example SQL statement to create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE chat_configs (
    chat_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    config JSONB
);
```

And here's how you can execute it with `psycopg2`:

```python
def create_table():
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_configs (
                chat_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
                config JSONB
            );
        """)
        conn.commit()
```

#### Inserting Data

To insert or update a chat's configuration:

```python
def upsert_chat_config(chat_id, config):
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
            INSERT INTO chat_configs (chat_id, config)
            VALUES (%s, %s)
            ON CONFLICT (chat_id) DO UPDATE
            SET config = EXCLUDED.config;
        """, (chat_id, config))
        conn.commit()
```

#### Retrieving Data

To retrieve a chat's configuration:

```python
def get_chat_config(chat_id):
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT config FROM chat_configs WHERE chat_id = %s;
        """, (chat_id,))
        config = cursor.fetchone()
        return config[0] if config else None
```

#### Closing the Connection

It's important to close the connection when your application stops:

```python
conn.close()
```

### Notes

- When deploying on Heroku, manage database connections carefully. Heroku limits the number of connections based on your database plan.
- Always use environment variables (like `DATABASE_URL`) for sensitive information and avoid hard-coding credentials in your source code.
- Consider using connection pooling (e.g., with `psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool`) for more efficient use of database connections, especially important for web applications or bots serving multiple users.

This introduction covers the basics of using `psycopg2` to manage chat configurations for a Telegram bot. Adjust the SQL and Python code as necessary to fit your application's specific needs.
