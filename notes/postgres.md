# Basics;
PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres, is an advanced, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, robustness, and performance. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying. PostgreSQL is highly extensible with features such as custom functions and data types, and it supports a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks. Here are some of the basics to get you started with PostgreSQL:

### Key Features

1. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL guarantees atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), ensuring reliable transactions and data integrity.
2. **Rich Data Types**: Supports a wide range of data types including primitive types (integer, numeric, string), structured (date/time, array, range), document (JSON/JSONB, XML, key-value), geometric, and custom types.
3. **Extensibility**: Users can define their own data types, custom functions, and more. It also supports the creation of extensions to add new functionalities.
4. **Concurrency**: Uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle concurrent data access, providing high levels of performance and scalability.
5. **Full-Text Search**: Offers powerful full-text search capabilities that are easy to use.
6. **Security**: Provides strong security features, including robust access control system, column and row-level security, SSL support, and more.

### Basic Operations

#### Installation

PostgreSQL can be installed on various operating systems. On Ubuntu, you can install it using:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

On macOS, using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install postgresql
```

#### Starting and Stopping the Server

On Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo service postgresql start
sudo service postgresql stop
```

On macOS (using Homebrew):

```sh
brew services start postgresql
brew services stop postgresql
```

#### Using the PostgreSQL Command Line Interface

After installation, you can interact with PostgreSQL using the `psql` command-line interface. To start `psql` under the default PostgreSQL user:

```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```

#### Basic SQL Operations

- **Create a Database**:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

- **Switch Connection to a Database**:

```sql
\c mydatabase
```

- **Create a Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

- **Insert Data**:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username) VALUES ('john_doe');
```

- **Query Data**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

- **Update Data**:

```sql
UPDATE users SET username = 'jane_doe' WHERE id = 1;
```

- **Delete Data**:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

#### Connecting to PostgreSQL from an Application

Connecting to PostgreSQL from a programming language or framework typically involves using a database driver or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool specific to your language or framework of choice, such as psycopg2 for Python, pg for Node.js, or ActiveRecord for Ruby on Rails.

### Documentation and Learning

PostgreSQL has comprehensive documentation that covers all aspects of the database, from basic usage to advanced features. The official PostgreSQL documentation is a great place to start learning in depth: [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

As you grow more comfortable with PostgreSQL, you'll discover its powerful features that make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale enterprise systems.




















# CRUD basics:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and manipulating databases. Below, you'll find an overview of the basics of SQL, focusing on creating tables and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These operations are fundamental for managing data in any relational database management system (RDBMS) like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.

### Creating Tables

To store data in a database, you first need to create a table. A table is defined with a specific set of columns, each with its own data type and possibly constraints (e.g., primary key, unique, not null).

#### Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

In this example, `SERIAL` is a PostgreSQL data type that automatically increments. `VARCHAR(n)` is a variable-length character string with a maximum length of `n`. `TIMESTAMP` stores date and time.

        This SQL statement defines the structure of a `users` table in a PostgreSQL database. Each component of the statement specifies how data is organized and managed within the table. Let's break down the key concepts:

        ### CREATE TABLE

        - `CREATE TABLE users`: This command creates a new table in the database named `users`.

        ### Columns and Data Types

        Each line within the parentheses defines a column in the table:

        - `id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`: 
        - `id`: The name of the column.
        - `SERIAL`: A PostgreSQL data type used for auto-incrementing integer values. It's commonly used for primary keys. Each time a new record is inserted into the table, this value automatically increments, ensuring each record has a unique `id`.
        - `PRIMARY KEY`: A constraint that uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain unique values and cannot contain `NULL` values. This constraint helps maintain the integrity of the database by ensuring that no two rows can have the same primary key value.

        - `username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL`: 
        - `username`: Column name.
        - `VARCHAR(50)`: Data type for variable-length character strings, with a maximum length of 50 characters. If you enter a string that is shorter than the maximum, PostgreSQL will only use the space needed.
        - `UNIQUE`: A constraint ensuring all values in the column are different from each other.
        - `NOT NULL`: A constraint specifying that the column cannot have a `NULL` value, meaning every record must include a value for `username`.

        - `email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL`: Similar to `username`, but allows up to 100 characters for an email address.

        - `password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL`: Stores passwords with a maximum length of 50 characters. Every record must include a password value, but it's not marked as `UNIQUE` because the table design doesn't prevent multiple users from having the same password.

        - `created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`: 
        - `created_at`: Column name.
        - `TIMESTAMP`: Data type for storing date and time values.
        - `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`: A default value constraint. If no value is provided for `created_at` when a new record is inserted, PostgreSQL will automatically fill in the current date and time. This is useful for tracking when records are created.

        ### Key Concepts

        - **Data Types**: Define the nature of the data that can be stored in each column. PostgreSQL offers a variety of data types for different purposes, including integer types, floating-point numbers, character strings, binary data, and date/time values.

        - **Constraints**: Rules applied to column values. They are used to enforce data integrity. In this table:
        - `PRIMARY KEY` ensures uniqueness and non-nullability for the `id` column.
        - `UNIQUE` ensures that all values in a column are unique across the table.
        - `NOT NULL` ensures that a column cannot store `NULL` values.
        - `DEFAULT` sets a default value for a column if no value is specified during insertion.

        Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing efficient and reliable databases. Constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, and `NOT NULL` help ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data stored within the database, while data types and default values ensure that data is stored in a consistent and predictable manner.











### Inserting Data (Create)

To add a new row to a table, use the `INSERT` statement.

#### Example

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com', 'secret');
```
        INSERT INTO users: This indicates the start of an insertion query and specifies the target table (users) into which the new data will be inserted.

        (username, email, password): This part specifies the columns of the users table that the new data will be inserted into. In this case, the data will be inserted into the username, email, and password columns. It's important to list the columns in the order in which the corresponding values are provided.

        VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com', 'secret'): This part specifies the actual data values to insert into the specified columns. Each value corresponds to the column listed in the same position:

        'john_doe' will be inserted into the username column,
        'john@example.com' into the email column, and
        'secret' into the password column.



### Reading Data (Read)

To retrieve data from a table, use the `SELECT` statement. You can specify conditions with the `WHERE` clause and sort the result set with the `ORDER BY` clause.

#### Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM users; -- Retrieves all columns for all rows
SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = 1; -- Retrieves specific columns for rows matching the condition
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC; -- Retrieves all columns for all rows, sorted by the created_at column
```

### Updating Data (Update)

To modify existing rows in a table, use the `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows should be updated.

#### Example

```sql
UPDATE users SET password = 'new_secret' WHERE id = 1;
```

### Deleting Data (Delete)

To remove rows from a table, use the `DELETE` statement, typically with a `WHERE` clause to avoid deleting all rows.

#### Example

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

### Additional Concepts

- **Primary Key**: A column or a set of columns used to uniquely identify each row in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It's used to establish a link between the data in two tables.
- **Indexes**: Used to speed up the search queries by essentially allowing the database to skip scanning every row in a table.
- **Transactions**: Allow multiple SQL statements to be executed as a single atomic operation, ensuring data integrity.
- **Joins**: Used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Remember, SQL syntax can vary slightly between different RDBMS, so always check the documentation for the specific database you're working with.




















# Using Postgres with a python app;
Using PostgreSQL for a Python app, especially one deployed on Heroku, is a common choice due to PostgreSQL's reliability and robust features. For Python applications, `psycopg2` is a popular PostgreSQL database adapter, enabling you to interact with PostgreSQL databases in an efficient and Pythonic way. Let's go through the basics of setting up and using `psycopg2` in the context of storing configurations for different chats for a Telegram bot written with the Telebot library.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into code examples, ensure you have:

- A PostgreSQL database set up. On Heroku, you can add a Postgres addon to your application from the Heroku dashboard.
- The `psycopg2` package installed in your Python environment. If you're deploying on Heroku, also add it to your `requirements.txt` file.
- Basic knowledge of SQL for creating tables and performing CRUD operations.

### Setting Up `psycopg2`

1. **Install psycopg2**: Install the package using pip. If you're working in a local development environment, run:

   ```sh
   pip install psycopg2-binary
   ```

   For Heroku deployment, add `psycopg2-binary` to your `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Database Connection**: Use the DATABASE_URL from your Heroku Postgres addon to connect to your database. Heroku automatically adds this environment variable when you add a Postgres database.

   ```python
   import psycopg2
   import os

   DATABASE_URL = os.environ['DATABASE_URL']

   conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL, sslmode='require')
   ```
        conn =

        This part of the code assigns the result of the psycopg2.connect() function to the variable conn. The variable conn now holds a connection object that represents the database connection. This object is used to execute commands and interact with the database.
        psycopg2.connect()

        psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language. The connect() function is used to create a new database session and return a new connection instance.
        This function is the primary way to connect to a PostgreSQL database from a Python application when using psycopg2.
        (DATABASE_URL,

        DATABASE_URL is a variable that contains the connection string required to connect to the PostgreSQL database. This string includes information such as the database hostname, database name, user name, password, port, and other necessary parameters to establish the connection.
        In many environments, especially in cloud platforms like Heroku, DATABASE_URL is provided as an environment variable. This allows for secure and flexible configuration without hardcoding sensitive information in the source code.
        sslmode='require')

        This parameter specifies that SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is required for the connection to the PostgreSQL database.
        sslmode='require' ensures that the data transmitted between the application and the database is encrypted for security. This is particularly important when connecting to a database over the internet or in other potentially insecure environments.
        The sslmode='require' setting is often used in cloud-hosted databases to ensure that all connections are secure and protected against eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.






### Basic Operations with `psycopg2`

#### Creating a Table

To store configurations for different chats, you'll need a table. Here's an example SQL statement to create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE chat_configs (
    chat_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    config JSONB
);
```

And here's how you can execute it with `psycopg2`:

```python
def create_table():
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_configs (
                chat_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
                config JSONB
            );
        """)
        conn.commit()
```

This Python function, `create_table`, uses `psycopg2` to interact with a PostgreSQL database for the purpose of creating a new table named `chat_configs`. Here's a line-by-line explanation:

- `def create_table():` 
- This line defines a Python function named `create_table`. Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. In this case, the function takes no parameters.

- `with conn.cursor() as cursor:`
- This line establishes a context manager for working with the database using a cursor object. 
- `conn` is a previously established connection to a PostgreSQL database using `psycopg2`.
- `.cursor()` is a method that returns a new cursor object, allowing you to execute PostgreSQL commands through Python code. 
- `as cursor` assigns the cursor object returned by `conn.cursor()` to the variable `cursor`. The use of `with` ensures that resources are properly managed: the cursor will automatically be closed when the block of code within the `with` statement is exited, regardless of whether the exit is because of an error or normal completion.

- `cursor.execute("""...""")`
- This line uses the `execute` method of the cursor object to run a SQL command.
- The triple quotes `"""` allow for a multi-line string, making it easier to write and read the SQL command.
- The SQL command inside the triple quotes is `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_configs (...)`. This command attempts to create a new table named `chat_configs` in the database, but only if a table with that name does not already exist.

- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_configs (...);`
- This SQL statement creates a new table called `chat_configs` in the PostgreSQL database if it doesn't already exist.
- `chat_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,` defines a column named `chat_id` with a data type of `BIGINT`. This column is designated as the primary key for the table, meaning it will uniquely identify each row. `BIGINT` is chosen to accommodate large integer values, which is useful for storing Telegram chat IDs.
- `config JSONB` defines another column named `config` with a data type of `JSONB`. `JSONB` is a binary representation of JSON data, allowing for efficient storage and querying of structured JSON data. This could be used to store configuration settings for a chat in a structured, but flexible format.

- `conn.commit()`
- This line commits the current transaction to the database. In the context of creating a table, it means the changes made by the `CREATE TABLE` statement are saved to the database. 
- It's important to commit transactions to ensure that any changes you make within a transaction are permanently applied to the database. In `psycopg2`, not all operations are auto-committed, so explicitly calling `commit` is necessary to save changes like creating a new table.

In summary, this function `create_table` uses `psycopg2` to create a new table named `chat_configs` in a PostgreSQL database, designed to store chat IDs as integers and associated configurations in a flexible JSONB format, ensuring that the table is only created if it does not already exist.

#### Inserting Data

To insert or update a chat's configuration:

```python
def upsert_chat_config(chat_id, config):
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
            INSERT INTO chat_configs (chat_id, config)
            VALUES (%s, %s)
            ON CONFLICT (chat_id) DO UPDATE
            SET config = EXCLUDED.config;
        """, (chat_id, config))
        conn.commit()
```

#### Retrieving Data

To retrieve a chat's configuration:

```python
def get_chat_config(chat_id):
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT config FROM chat_configs WHERE chat_id = %s;
        """, (chat_id,))
        config = cursor.fetchone()
        return config[0] if config else None
```

#### Closing the Connection

It's important to close the connection when your application stops:

```python
conn.close()
```

### Notes

- When deploying on Heroku, manage database connections carefully. Heroku limits the number of connections based on your database plan.
- Always use environment variables (like `DATABASE_URL`) for sensitive information and avoid hard-coding credentials in your source code.
- Consider using connection pooling (e.g., with `psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool`) for more efficient use of database connections, especially important for web applications or bots serving multiple users.

This introduction covers the basics of using `psycopg2` to manage chat configurations for a Telegram bot. Adjust the SQL and Python code as necessary to fit your application's specific needs.
