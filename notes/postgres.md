# Basics;
PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres, is an advanced, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, robustness, and performance. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying. PostgreSQL is highly extensible with features such as custom functions and data types, and it supports a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks. Here are some of the basics to get you started with PostgreSQL:

### Key Features

1. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL guarantees atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), ensuring reliable transactions and data integrity.
2. **Rich Data Types**: Supports a wide range of data types including primitive types (integer, numeric, string), structured (date/time, array, range), document (JSON/JSONB, XML, key-value), geometric, and custom types.
3. **Extensibility**: Users can define their own data types, custom functions, and more. It also supports the creation of extensions to add new functionalities.
4. **Concurrency**: Uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle concurrent data access, providing high levels of performance and scalability.
5. **Full-Text Search**: Offers powerful full-text search capabilities that are easy to use.
6. **Security**: Provides strong security features, including robust access control system, column and row-level security, SSL support, and more.

### Basic Operations

#### Installation

PostgreSQL can be installed on various operating systems. On Ubuntu, you can install it using:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

On macOS, using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install postgresql
```

#### Starting and Stopping the Server

On Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo service postgresql start
sudo service postgresql stop
```

On macOS (using Homebrew):

```sh
brew services start postgresql
brew services stop postgresql
```

#### Using the PostgreSQL Command Line Interface

After installation, you can interact with PostgreSQL using the `psql` command-line interface. To start `psql` under the default PostgreSQL user:

```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```

#### Basic SQL Operations

- **Create a Database**:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

- **Switch Connection to a Database**:

```sql
\c mydatabase
```

- **Create a Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

- **Insert Data**:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username) VALUES ('john_doe');
```

- **Query Data**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

- **Update Data**:

```sql
UPDATE users SET username = 'jane_doe' WHERE id = 1;
```

- **Delete Data**:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

#### Connecting to PostgreSQL from an Application

Connecting to PostgreSQL from a programming language or framework typically involves using a database driver or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool specific to your language or framework of choice, such as psycopg2 for Python, pg for Node.js, or ActiveRecord for Ruby on Rails.

### Documentation and Learning

PostgreSQL has comprehensive documentation that covers all aspects of the database, from basic usage to advanced features. The official PostgreSQL documentation is a great place to start learning in depth: [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

As you grow more comfortable with PostgreSQL, you'll discover its powerful features that make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale enterprise systems.
