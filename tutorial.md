Deploying a simple "Hello World" web app using Python and Flask on Heroku involves several steps, from writing the application code to deploying it on Heroku. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Git**: If you don't have Git installed, download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

3. **Install Heroku CLI**: Download and install the Heroku CLI from the Heroku website: [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

### Step 2: Create Your Flask Application

1. **Create a New Directory** for your project and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir hello-world-flask
   cd hello-world-flask
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Flask**:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask gunicorn
   ```

4. **Create `app.py`**: This is your main application file. Add the following Flask application code:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, World!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run()
   ```

### Step 3: Prepare for Heroku Deployment

1. **Create `requirements.txt`**: List all the Python dependencies for your app:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create a `Procfile`**: This file tells Heroku how to run your application. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory of your project and add the following line:

   ```
   web: gunicorn app:app
   ```

3. **Create `runtime.txt`** (optional): Specify a Python runtime. For example, to use Python 3.9:

   ```
   python-3.9.13
   ```

### Step 4: Initialize a Git Repository

1. **Initialize Git**:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Your Files to the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit Your Changes**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

### Step 5: Deploy to Heroku

1. **Log in to Heroku**:

   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

2. **Create a Heroku App**:

   ```bash
   heroku create
   ```

   This command will create a new app on Heroku and add a remote named `heroku` to your Git configuration.

3. **Deploy Your Application**:

   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

   If your main branch is named differently (like `master`), adjust the command accordingly.

4. **Open Your Application** in a web browser:

   ```bash
   heroku open
   ```

   This command opens a web browser to your application's URL.

### Step 6: View Your Application

After running `heroku open`, your default web browser will open to your new Heroku app displaying "Hello, World!".

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during deployment, use `heroku logs --tail` to view real-time logs for your application, which can help in diagnosing problems.
- Ensure all files, including `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, and `runtime.txt`, are correctly named and located in the root directory of your project.

By following these steps, you'll have a simple "Hello World" Flask application running on Heroku.
